Perfect for presenting descriptive statistics,\ncomparing group demographics (e.g creating a Table 1 for\nmedical journals), and more. Automatically detects continuous,\ncategorical, and dichotomous variables in your data set, calculates\nappropriate descriptive statistics, and also includes amount of\nmissingness in each variable.\nSummarize regression\nmodels\nin R and include reference rows for categorical variables. Common\nregression models, such as logistic regression and Cox proportional\nhazards regression, are automatically identified and the tables are\npre-filled with appropriate column headers (i.e. Odds Ratio and\nHazard Ratio).\nCustomize gtsummary\ntables\nusing a growing list of formatting/styling functions.\nBold\nlabels,\nitalicize\nlevels, add\np-value\nto summary tables,\nstyle\nthe statistics however you choose,\nmerge\nor\nstack\ntables to present results side by side… there are so many\npossibilities to create the table of your dreams!\nReport statistics\ninline\nfrom summary tables and

of additional information may be cumbersome to apply to models that yield a continuous result.\nDecision curve analysis is a method for evaluating and comparing prediction models that incorporates clinical consequences, requires only the data set on which the models are tested, and can be applied to models that have either continuous or dichotomous results.\nDetailed tutorial and installation instructions at https://www.danieldsjoberg.com/dca-tutorial/dca-tutorial-r.html\nR package website: http://www.danieldsjoberg.com/dcurves/\n\nVickers AJ, Elkin EB. “Decision curve analysis: a novel method for evaluating prediction models.” Medical Decision Making. 2006 Nov-Dec;26(6):565-74.\nVickers AJ, Cronin AM, Elkin EB, Gonen M. “Extensions to decision curve analysis, a novel method for evaluating diagnostic tests, prediction models and molecular markers.” BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making. 2008 Nov 26;8(1):53.\nggsurvfit\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLanguage R\nThe {ggsurvfit} package eases the creation of time-to-event (aka survival) endpoint figures with ggplot.\nThe concise and modular code creates images that are ready for publication or sharing.\nEach of the functions that add to or modify the existing ggplot are written as proper ggplot geoms or stat methods, allowing the functions from this package to be combined with any functions or customization from ggplot and other ggplot extensions.\n\nInstallation Code: install.packages(\"ggsurvfit\")\nMore information at http://www.danieldsjoberg.com/ggsurvfit/\nstarter\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLanguage R\nGet started with new projects by dropping a skeleton of a new project into a new or existing directory, initialise git repositories, and create reproducible environments with the ‘renv’ package.\nThe package allows for dynamically named files, folders, file content, as well as the functionality to drop individual template files into existing projects.\n\nInstallation Code: install.packages(\"starter\")\nMore information at http://www.danieldsjoberg.com/starter/\nrstudio.prefs\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLanguage R\nAs of RStudio v1.3, the preferences in the Global Options dialog (and a number of other preferences that aren’t) are now saved in simple, plain-text JSON files.\nThis package provides an interface for working with these RStudio JSON preference files to easily make modifications without using the point-and-click option menus.\nThis is particularly helpful when working on teams to ensure a unified experience across machines and utilizing settings for best practices.\n\nInstallation Code: install.packages(\"rstudio.prefs\")\nMore information at http://www.danieldsjoberg.com/rstudio.prefs/\ngtreg\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLanguage R\nThe {gtreg} package creates tabular data summaries appropriate for regulatory submissions.\nThe package builds the tables using {gtsummary}.\n\nInstallation Code: install.packages(\"gtreg\")\nMore information at https://shannonpileggi.github.io/gtreg/\nbroom.helpers\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLanguage R\nThe {broom.helpers} package provides suite of functions to work with regression model broom::tidy() tibbles.\nThe suite includes functions to group regression model terms by variable, insert reference and header rows for categorical variables, add variable labels, and more.\n{broom.helpers} is used, in particular, by gtsummary::tbl_regression() for producing nice formatted tables of model coefficients and by GGally::ggcoef_model() for plotting model coefficients.\n\nInstallation Code: install.packages(\"broom.helpers\")\nMore information at https://larmarange.github.io/broom.helpers/\nvisR\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLanguage R\nEnables fit-for-purpose, reusable clinical and medical research focused visualizations and tables with sensible defaults and based on sound graphical principles.\n\nInstallation Code: install.packages(\"visR\")\nMore information at https://openpharma.github.io/visR/\ntidycmprsk\nLanguage R\nThe {tidycmprsk} package provides an intuitive interface for working with the competing risk endpoints.\nThe package wraps the {cmprsk} package, and exports functions for univariate cumulative incidence estimates with cuminc() and competing risk regression with crr().\nThe package also includes broom-style tidiers: tidy(), augment(), and glance().\nInstallation Code: install.packages(\"tidycmprsk\")\nMore information at https://mskcc-epi-bio.github.io/tidycmprsk/\nbstfun\nLanguage R\nA miscellaneous collection of functions to used by members of the Biostatistics Department at MSKCC.\nFunctions in the {bstfun} package do not fall within the well-defined packages with more narrow scope used by the department.\nInstallation Code: devtools::install_github(\"ddsjoberg/bstfun\")\nMore information at http://www.danieldsjoberg.com/bstfun/\nContributions\ngtExtras\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLanguage R\nThe goal of {gtExtras} is to provide some additional helper functions to assist in creating beautiful tables with {gt.}\nThe functions are generally wrappers around boilerplate or adding capabilities that are currently not yet built into {gt}. The {gt} package is amazing, make sure to go read the official documentation.\n\nInstallation Code: remotes::install_github(\"jthomasmock/gtExtras\")\nMore information at https://jthomasmock.github.io/gtExtras/\nbroom\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLanguage R\nThe {broom} package summarizes key information about models in tidy tibbles.\n{broom} provides three verbs to make it convenient to interact with model objects: tidy(), glance(), and augment().\n\nInstallation Code: install.packages(\"broom\")\nMore information at https://broom.tidymodels.org/\n\n\n\n",
