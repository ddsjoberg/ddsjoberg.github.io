```
</a>
Language **R**

The {gtsummary} package provides an elegant and flexible way to create publication-ready analytic and summary tables using the **R** programming language. 
The {gtsummary} package summarizes data sets, regression models, and more, using sensible defaults with highly customizable capabilities.
By leveraging [{broom}](https://broom.tidymodels.org/), [{gt}](https://gt.rstudio.com/), and [{labelled}](http://larmarange.github.io/labelled/) packages, {gtsummary} creates beautifully formatted, ready-to-share summary and result tables in a single line of R code!  

:::

  - [**Summarize data frames or
    tibbles**](http://www.danieldsjoberg.com/gtsummary/articles/tbl_summary.html)
    easily in **R**. Perfect for presenting descriptive statistics,
    comparing group **demographics** (e.g creating a **Table 1** for
    medical journals), and more. Automatically detects continuous,
    categorical, and dichotomous variables in your data set, calculates
    appropriate descriptive statistics, and also includes amount of
    missingness in each variable.

  - [**Summarize regression
    models**](http://www.danieldsjoberg.com/gtsummary/articles/tbl_regression.html)
    in R and include reference rows for categorical variables. Common
    regression models, such as logistic regression and Cox proportional
    hazards regression, are automatically identified and the tables are
    pre-filled with appropriate column headers (i.e. Odds Ratio and
    Hazard Ratio).

  - [**Customize gtsummary
    tables**](http://www.danieldsjoberg.com/gtsummary/reference/index.html#section-general-formatting-styling-functions)
    using a growing list of formatting/styling functions.

    levels, **[add

    to summary tables,
    **[style](http://www.danieldsjoberg.com/gtsummary/reference/style_percent.html)**
    the statistics however you choose,
    **[merge](http://www.danieldsjoberg.com/gtsummary/reference/tbl_merge.html)**
    or
    **[stack](http://www.danieldsjoberg.com/gtsummary/reference/tbl_stack.html)**
    tables to present results side by side… there are so many
    possibilities to create the table of your dreams\!

  - **[Report statistics

    from summary tables and regression summary tables in **R markdown**.
    Make your reports completely reproducible\!

## Decision Curve Analysis

Languages **R**, **Stata**, **SAS**

Decision-analytic techniques allow assessment of clinical outcomes but often require collection of additional information may be cumbersome to apply to models that yield a continuous result.
Decision curve analysis is a method for evaluating and comparing prediction models that incorporates clinical consequences, requires only the data set on which the models are tested, and can be applied to models that have either continuous or dichotomous results.

knitr::include_graphics("images/ggsurvfit.png")
```
</a>
Language **R**

The {ggsurvfit} package eases the creation of time-to-event (aka survival) endpoint figures with ggplot.
The concise and modular code creates images that are ready for publication or sharing.
Each of the functions that add to or modify the existing ggplot are written as proper ggplot geoms or stat methods, allowing the functions from this package to be combined with any functions or customization from ggplot and other ggplot extensions.

Language **R**

As of RStudio v1.3, the preferences in the Global Options dialog (and a number of other preferences that aren’t) are now saved in simple, plain-text JSON files.
This package provides an interface for working with these RStudio JSON preference files to easily make modifications without using the point-and-click option menus.
This is particularly helpful when working on teams to ensure a unified experience across machines and utilizing settings for best practices.
