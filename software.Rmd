## Decision Curve Analysis 

Decision-analytic techniques allow assessment of clinical outcomes but often require collection of additional information may be cumbersome to apply to models that yield a continuous result. Decision curve analysis is a method for evaluating and comparing prediction models that incorporates clinical consequences, requires only the data set on which the models are tested, and can be applied to models that have either continuous or dichotomous results.

## Kernel Smoothing <a href="sjosmooth"><img src="images/logo-small.png" align="right" /></a>

A kernel smoother is a technique to estimate a curve as the weighted average of neighboring observed data.  The `sjosmooth` package (pronounced sō smüt͟h) was built primarily to perform kernel smoothing on censored time-to-event or survival data. The package provides kernel smoothed estimates of survival probabilities at specified times.
