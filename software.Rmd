The {gtsummary} package provides an elegant and flexible way to create
publication-ready analytical and summary tables using the **R**
programming language. The {gtsummary} package summarizes data sets,
regression models, and more, using sensible defaults with highly
customizable capabilities.

  - [**Summarize data frames or
    tibbles**](http://www.danieldsjoberg.com/gtsummary/articles/tbl_summary.html)
    easily in **R**. Perfect for presenting descriptive statistics,
    comparing group **demographics** (e.g creating a **Table 1** for
    medical journals), and more. Automatically detects continuous,
    categorical, and dichotomous variables in your data set, calculates
    appropriate descriptive statistics, and also includes amount of
    missingness in each variable.

  - [**Summarize regression
    models**](http://www.danieldsjoberg.com/gtsummary/articles/tbl_regression.html)
    in R and include reference rows for categorical variables. Common
    regression models, such as logistic regression and Cox proportional
    hazards regression, are automatically identified and the tables are
    pre-filled with appropriate column headers (i.e. Odds Ratio and
    Hazard Ratio).

  - [**Customize gtsummary
    tables**](http://www.danieldsjoberg.com/gtsummary/reference/index.html#section-general-formatting-styling-functions)
    using a growing list of formatting/styling functions.
    **[Bold](http://www.danieldsjoberg.com/gtsummary/reference/bold_italicize_labels_levels.html)**
    labels,
    **[italicize](http://www.danieldsjoberg.com/gtsummary/reference/bold_italicize_labels_levels.html)**
    levels, **[add
    p-value](http://www.danieldsjoberg.com/gtsummary/reference/add_p.html)**
    to summary tables,
    **[style](http://www.danieldsjoberg.com/gtsummary/reference/style_percent.html)**
    the statistics however you choose,
    **[merge](http://www.danieldsjoberg.com/gtsummary/reference/tbl_merge.html)**
    or
    **[stack](http://www.danieldsjoberg.com/gtsummary/reference/tbl_stack.html)**
    tables to present results side by side… there are so many
    possibilities to create the table of your dreams\!

  - **[Report statistics
    inline](http://www.danieldsjoberg.com/gtsummary/articles/tbl_summary.html#inline_text)**
    from summary tables and regression summary tables in **R markdown**.
    Make your reports completely reproducible\!

Installation Code: `install.packages("gtsummary")`

## Decision Curve Analysis 

Decision-analytic techniques allow assessment of clinical outcomes but often require collection of additional information may be cumbersome to apply to models that yield a continuous result. Decision curve analysis is a method for evaluating and comparing prediction models that incorporates clinical consequences, requires only the data set on which the models are tested, and can be applied to models that have either continuous or dichotomous results.

## Kernel Smoothing <a href="http://www.danieldsjoberg.com/sjosmooth/"><img src="images/logo-small.png" align="right" height="170" /></a>

A kernel smoother is a technique to estimate a curve as the weighted average of neighboring observed data.  The `sjosmooth` package (pronounced sō smüt͟h) was built primarily to perform kernel smoothing on censored time-to-event or survival data. The package provides kernel smoothed estimates of survival probabilities at specified times.

* R Package 
    + Installation Code: `devtools::install_github("ddsjoberg/sjosmooth")`
    + Package documentation, examples, and explaination of statistical theory is on the <a href="sjosmooth">package website</a>.
