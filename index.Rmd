I am a Senior Biostatistician at <a href="mskcc.org">Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center</a> in New York City.  I am also a DrPH candidate in Biostatistics at<a href="https://www.mailman.columbia.edu/become-student/departments/biostatistics"> Columbia University</a>.  As a part of my dissertation, I am engaged in reasearch about adpative methods in clinical trials.  In my time away from work and school, I like to bake, go to the beach, run, and program in R.
