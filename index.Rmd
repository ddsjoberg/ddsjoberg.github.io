I am a Senior Biostatistician at <a href="mskcc.org">Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center</a> in New York City.  I am also a DrPH candidate in Biostatistics at<a href="https://www.mailman.columbia.edu/become-student/departments/biostatistics"> Columbia University</a>.  My research interests include adaptive methods in clinical trials, precision medicine, predictive modeling, and prostate cancer screening methods.  In my time away from work and school, I enjoy baking, going to the beach, run, and programing in R.
